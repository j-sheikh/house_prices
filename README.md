In this project we had to predict house prices. Our task was it to compare different regression models, to investigate whether a feature selection is reasonable. (a) Train at least three different regression models1 and evaluate them with MSE and R2-score. Use cross-validation for evaluating your models. (b) Try out pre-processing techniques. (c) In the lecture you learned three types of feature selection. Choose two of them and implement at least one method for each. Experimentally evaluate your feature selections. (d) For the best performing combination of model and pre-processing steps, implement and plot the so-called learning curve on your own. Project_3 was a group project of the size of three.
